## **Excel Challenge**

### Q1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns? <br> 
1. The possibility of success (successful/failed) is much greater from February to May than the rest of the year. <br>
2. Projects < 5000 local currency has a higher success rate, >= 50000 projects have the highest failure and cancel rate. <br>
3. Theater parent category is the most popular, and Plays sub_category contributes significantly, while music category has the highest success rate. <br>

### Q2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
The sample size is rather small. Geography is too broad to draw detailed conclusion for potential campaigns. The individual donations are not recorded, it's hard to tell whether a campaign is backed by a few whales or bunch of plebs.

### Q3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can compare the difference in total and success rate for each Country. We can test if Spotlight and Staff_Pick has any correlation with success rate. Campaign duration vs success/failure rate would be also interesting.
